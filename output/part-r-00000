we generally judge book by author instead when we judge merit an ingenious composure but contrary name author ought be last thing we inquire into  disparity performance mans reputation cannot but be

discretion an author be extreamly reservd  our contemporaries unbyassed posterity will do us justice which often denyd us by thing we aim at point once gaind we may rest assured writings we ought always have perfection prospect as chief lives rather consults his private interest than his author who chiefly endeavours please taste age he  all as some merit praise for writing well so do others for not writing at  delicacy wit more assiduity than natural parts painful employment which requires more strength body than being critick not so much science as sort laborious  what hits their palate

matthew  allen thomas   index     this was all he could do he did being ready answer person for what he had written impersonally required which perhaps only possible guarantee case he promptly gave guarantee which honour his time his own generation too many this i maintain each however he same box almost every writer for press anonymous writing should never be personal if he did this both these matters perhaps others for neglecting sound rule stated what charge against him we may indeed blame him we are entitled know much more definitely than i have ever seen honour any country would find fault him at any rate i think just as he did later matter i do not believe court i do not know who he was thereupon lockhart took no further notice maintained his anonymity lord cockburn says was an open secret but hypocrisy unveiled anonym had like scott shirked had challenged anonymous author pamphlet bearing title matter there he had promptly come forward his own name which had happened earlier connection baron lauerwinkel perfectly ready back his opinion as may be seen from long affair reluctant adversary at all times lockhart seems have been satisfaction had been refused no one bound go on challenging challenge after scotts offensive words he had offered man this consideration will also account for his conduct not renewing his  was truth he was not editor blackwood had perfect right do so hardly necessary say be taken into account he chose inform public truth he after his refusal as unworthy notice gentleman not further private inquisitiveness but if not under menace but considering scott he was not bound let him take proviso or satisfy his who had declined go out having offered his adversary satisfaction conduct was perfectly consistent throughout he had challenged scott from scott what he published all world secondly his be observed first lockhart could not be said conceal lord clive we may call red white treaties seems odd but at first sight incident what from most notorious action  lie direct or both let us examine this scott or cowardice taking no notice scotts subsequent straightforwardness omitting part his explanation copy sent imputations made on him he charged either want concerned lockhart not them as far as i understand doubt patmores conduct was most reprehensible but we are here remark his bitter tongue into challenging christie there no timidity said have egged on scott have stung him by some person hazlitt himself no duellist even accused personal been brought on by errors judgment on part more than one i have elsewhere remarked this deplorable result said have  acquitted fled country christie traill took their trial were doing taking aim at his adversary wounding him mortally patmore were again exchanged christie this time as he can hardly be blamed for inexperienced probably unwilling baulk their adversaries shots refused both principal second on other side were however informed could should by all laws duello have been missed thereupon mr patmore demanded second shot which i am police magistrate christie fired air scott fired at christie g patmore christies mr traill afterwards well known as london scott challenged christie they went out scotts second being mr p christie his second did an altercation taking place between them scott called lockhart liar this lockhart took no notice but editorship was made one sent scott was omitted thereupon same time copy scott published form denial stigmatised him as coward he then published statement sending at blackwood lockhart declared scott had no right ask this scott refused fight unless lockhart would deny he was editor scotch barrister named christie as his second challenged scott but by name on this lockhart set out for london certain young thereupon scotts magazine london retorted attacking lockhart zeta assailed cockney school sufficiently scorpionlike manner like others was not i believe peculiar himwas zeta this one lockharts signatures blackwooda signature which however  published unpublished happened as far as can be made out from most trustworthy accounts white feather may be well give sketch what actually erroneous manner occasional implications lockhart showed this day being frequently referred what seems me an entirely mentioned more than once or twice foregoing pages as other matter much more important as duel itself has been  vague ex parte statement made long after date heard thirdly for actual interview its tenor we have only or considered himself be making any improper use what he had secondly by no means certain if he did he was making sufficient evidence lockhart wrote this blackwood article quarterly article here be observed first there no details blackwood attack which ranks next famous use them against poet afterwards thought he recognised some particulars about keats extracted from him promise he would not lockhart house bishop greig at stirling told him some think very damaging comes this keatss friend bailey met i do not think any one who examines mr colvins allegation will  discussion both these especially first may be worth little was first bruited abroad i think mr sidney colvins book on keats john scott editor london was shot newer one which prompted by one two things old scandal about duel which what he meant i can only suppose ebullition must have been rejoined i have not myself had any opportunity learning from him expected not few protests but i do not remember mr stevenson cad this extraordinary obiter dictum provoked as might have been ago when my friend mr louis stevenson thought proper call lockhart subsequently original publication my essay not very long which i have more than once referred text occurred most singular instance floating dislike lockharts memory   lockhart  appendix b     commended itself careful students his published works children others who were united him by ties affection has confirm idea both which however false may seem his conjectural notion his character they may on other hand may very well clear up fill hitherto rather fragmentary repute author confessions csars but they possible lives no letters indeed are likely increase literary most effective especially most truthtelling all interesting almost all cases considerable collection letters from specimens already printed must be very characteristic very one if results systematic publication his letters which regret at having offended de quinceys daughter will have been happy peculiarities should not have existed but matter except for my own exaggerated his peculiarities less possible i think those possible some his biographers those who knew him may have distinctly no imputation was ever intended quite only acquit de quincey all serious moral delinquencyi declare over seven years composition full personal idiosyncrasy i not not merely by autobiography itself but by mass notes spread should be wrong face such autobiographic details as are furnished quite wrong about man would be almost impossible be so future world though often not quite right never will not be materially altered by anything since published or likely published work all biographical evidence then accessible me imputing nothing discreditable intention founded on whole de quinceys character cast thought given text while hurt those feelings but i think i am entitled say view perhaps thoughtless forgetfulness feelings survivors have conclusion i have only repeat my regret i should by  whether false or true were unfavourable then purely meaningless not prove he himself had entertained on subject ideas which deathbed my dear mother then i was greatly mistaken if this does touching incident recorded biographies his crying on his his early treatment by his family i may surely shelter myself behind textually cited from himself if i seem have spoken harshly such as his mentioning wilson as his only intimate male friend are disappearance from his subsequent life peculiar some other points quincey had not spoken truly but i must still hold their total autobiography was published would no doubt have protested if de these persons or their representatives were alive when doubt on his actual acquaintance lord westport or lady carbery cannot be described as other than curious i had never intended throw lodging doubtless capable certain amount explanation person unfit be trusted money while his habit solitary from first last all who were concerned him treated him as almost every one else i gather from mrs baird smiths own remarks this mystery did not extend his children seems have extended critics has been he was way mysterious though no doubt respecting him almost unanimous verdict his acquaintances readers such memoirs reminiscences as have been published time as his impenetrability i can only throw myself on mystification was not so much exception as rule his earlier opiumeating not absolutely repugnant delusion literary he ever like lamb deliberately begat liechildren but decide against most de quinceys stories on i do not suppose internal evidence i am sure vast majority critics would joseph sell never existed such cases critic can only go on another borrovian who knew borrow which i never did life any rate apparently historic on other hand i have been told by lavengro found remarkable book some extent at runciman he himself once made considerable inquiries on track looks as if never had been true i have been informed by mr james there are some people who have knack recounting truth so grasmere at time so elsewhere as i have remarked about borrow did not produce single witness prove any malay had been near faithfully recorded incident but though events were then fresh he he disclaimed this no doubt truly he protested was he was accused having borrowed from something hoggs within few years truth this famous story was questioned take for instance malay incident we know from de quincey himself thing as strikes if not contemporary yet wellwilling junior not say anything unkind at all but simply give an account some really unkind things have been said de quincey my intention was dealing recent reputations when commentator gives his name impenetrability matter an instance difficulty mystery her fathers money affairs passage on his general certain comments on malay incident others like some on as appearing autobiography not heard afterwards general was certain remarks on de quinceys aristocratic acquaintances i found what had offended her her complaints being at first quite documents subsequent private correspondence mrs baird smith de quincey i thought better say so wait for further paper was impute anything can be properly called untruthfulness confute him but as very last intention i had writing critic existing evidence if new evidence were required if my intent had been hostile little fault could be justly found form letters which had been discovered i might have replied suspend their judgment until publication certain new documents i had accused her father untruthfulness requested public smith mrs baird smith complained letter newspapers widow one heroes indian mutiny colonel baird my great concern had given offence his daughter florence short time after publication my essay on de quincey i learnt   de quincey  appendix

well as some seemed indicate as best worth aiming at most selfsufficient what canons literary form standards literary perfection indifference what public or publishers liked as well as himself who went his own way all his life long complete still farther back who seems never have tried be anything but moreover he one english writer our time perhaps times than kingsleys has much stronger more

without some air superior undoubted fact fact not difficult understand though rather claims has yet forced itself as should on general public an doubt case many neither nor any other his letters

must have been very considerable though absence work here again lockhart was conspicuously guiltless his actual important fault undoubtedly journalism its tendency slovenly accused lockhart himself being one class still more all accounts he was lockharts time rather common no one ever swiss heaven or other place certainly not unknown by occasions saying what he does not like but mere journalist can generally get an opportunity saying what he likes avoid simply those who do so if man has faculty saying anything he says too many us write against our own party fault than those who have some experience if as george warrington unprincipled character journalism no doubt nobody knows better political principles there great deal nonsense talked about not one way or other consistent decided

point interest about lockhart has be mentioned he was  always there wrong presentment may course be matter opinion but such as perceive presentment whether right or whether conception subject only very dense reader can fail task representing his subject he has such perfect general carlyle allowed be his clear nervous forcible style so entirely volumes or essays half hundred pages he subordinates what even case lockharts biographies whether they are books half dozen as cellar when coals have been shot into now this never impression readers mind as dark though may be as full carlyle demands very properly demands fact total absence ninetynine out hundred biographies total impression which original writing but even then extracts are always luminous stringing together quotations far more troublesome than especially when remembered except dunce extraction writers an extent rather surprising so excellent penman more point quote extract from other much inferior here another criticism carlyles on burns not scott does this all his biographical efforts sometimes he appears for carlyle was criticising seems me further he always whether he meant do or not has done very book which unfortunately this exactly what seems me lockhart world acted on him as he acted on world so forth now very elevated because was not show scott as he was by nature as reasons lockharts plan was not seems case his scott critic here has fallen into dangerous temptation giving his carlyle thought an almost perfect biographer but as happens elevated what great many people said boswell whom complains lockharts conception his task was not very lockhart himself great politeness does not allow this unique highest merit biographer carlyle though treating never missed its mark never lumbered on way his most charm within certain limits master sharp light raillery merely as such poet or at least songwriter singular ability but there no doubt though lockhart was an admirable critic

reverence get better him drag him as abstracted from mere questions immediate obvious utility but protest against banishing from mind reverence for feeling been noted always manly robust he was never false his own early moreover characteristic lockhart as critic he as has pickwick no novelist first class had made an appearance magazines from appearance waverley more than an amusing contributor remarkably promising trifles has himself noted thackeray was at time he spoke nothing hook as novelist seems exaggerated must be remembered as he criticism which are interspersed scott book if his estimate colour as well as words nothing can be better than fragments evident he has knowledge feeling for art line than he has gabble mere connoisseur but constantly jargon or undisciplined fluency mere art critic any more different branches art he never has disgusting technical england his only important forerunner unite combine criticism great advance was he was one first lamb himself less severely than edinburgh another point which lockhart made their merits this very passage blackwood condemned not wordsworth lamb were by no means taken hearts tories on remembered whatever might be case coleridge wordsworth charles lamb coleridge excellent must be rejoicing ignorance which enabled contemporary critics poohpooh spontaneous characteristic works denunciation facetious its faults one his best particularly one his most feeble one beforementioned peters letters which all one was certainly not narrow critic just as he certainly was not now lockhart within his own range was for time very wide  critics as whatever good all kinds poets they are as much bound accept whatever good all kinds given thank god therefor but let them at same time remember not given all critics admire all styles alike let those whom masculine abhorrent gush third unfortunately disgustful critic who like lockhart was above all things early if not his later manner must have been highly rightly second no one can fairly deny some points mr tennysons principles his paper after all not worst fault critic always rightly or wrongly set its face certain loyalty development schools poetry against which

what lord tennyson himself has done itself critics critic best justification lockharts itself critic very different from what when presents wont forget work criticised was very often as presented author was going do as well as what he had actually done assume or rather imagine critic must have known what criticism after some time apt be doubly unjust wont paralleled from groves blarney fact criticism nobody i suppose would now defend wondrous stanza which was application without laughing he must be an extremely sensitive peer distance time can think famous strawberry story its criticism perfectly just if lord tennyson himself at this safe cruel criticism existence second most if not all extremely clever being perhaps very best example politely worse lockhart because this article first place laureate but i am unable think much worse or indeed any facts now i do not think i yield any man living admiration his by professor ferrier who through wilson must have known no manner doubt lockharts indeed quoted as article sometimes spoken as crokers but there can be seems be famous quarterly article on lord tennysons volume head front lockharts offending purely literary view  sift prove false which has endured simply because no trouble has been taken quite sufficient create reputation partly exaggerated partly quite dignities his position as leader en titre tory journalism

wilsons friendship seems have been mixed small grain lockhart noctes are not very numerous they are valuable for noctes may be observed though references verge madness have his articles greatly improved hint should say if there one thing which drives contributor many places he greatly improved his contributors articles i number privileged writers send what they like we are told means an

he was not given some extent deserved one hooks reproaches no man questioned his inasmuch as lockhart himself had certainly not escaped had perhaps considerable danger overextenuation danger was greater setting down aught malice but there might be thought be treat him harshly an obituary notice there was no danger his impossible for lockhart political sympathiser personal friend was nearly impossible for any one respect him yet was quite was different kind great many people liked theodore hook but biography as either two books just mentioned here difficulty lockharts aptitude for great

literary point view point view workmanship form comparison matter merely from properly perpetual comparison boswell may be said once for all have perhaps obscured literary value book some readers background seems constantly be merely editing scotts words less skilful than modest which biographer keeps himself scott extraordinary interest subject fashion no but at same time far more difficult task famous life these good qualities were shown even better advantage pleasanter  those who know what criticism really means fails please fanatics on either side he cannot fail please from depreciation if as necessary consequence he failed two views mans character he holds aloof equally from engouement common expedient seesawing between two sides two parties or biography he never extremes he never avoids extremes by criticism robust quiet sanity fitted him admirably for task whole account burns indeed main characteristic lockharts perfectly tolerant judicious fair same may be said his worse but biographers treatment both these subjects goodnatured tory might be excused for regarding as something very much themselves admitted be imprudent freaks which even permitted himself manifestations political opinion which whigs tory burns during later part his life at any rate had having by turns patronised neglected burns lockhart was decided edinburgh society was still when he wrote very sore at charge edinburgh societyindeed he had long formed part itand considerable difficulty matter lockhart was familiar now though i am told for scotchman there still especially for

but he not only as has been said wrote for contribute blackwood i am not sure some phrases noctes by no means reduced his general literary activity whether he continued has been said his removal

debate between philosophy tarwater laudanum would be away what we have not but if any one chose write antique really required his case gave us what we have as much as took whatever occasional excesses he may have committed opium was entirely de quinceys fault seems be generally recognised now as he would have stood above bacon esoteric value was not philosopher who would have stood as far above kant exoteric graces one unquestionable curse opium deprived us an english inability undertake sustained labour which he himself recognises as goldenmouthed at expression he had ample leisure but at command he was his way as brazenbowelled at work as he was write perfect english he had every resource illustration relief but he was somewhat indolent had many avocations de quincey could exponents have been able give mansel could do both these things all sciences most requires which all its really supreme philosophy play literary miscellaneous illustration which did write english but he could not as de quincey could throw upon hamilton either could not or would not write english ferrier could like his powers this department these three men sir william masterpieces only three men during de quinceys lifetime had anything know i fear opium fiend cheated world something like years which he seems really have known whatever there was literature go upon metaphysics which he gave himself up for new study he had neither sufficient facts nor sufficient views often are from fact his time was practically himself his political economy suffered perhaps little acute as his two classes severer study which he specially addicted surface connected his readings together better than southey did his own departments they were numerous he went farther below powerful acute he was not exactly as southey was omnilegent but supercherie as tartars spanish nun wonderfully fancy at other times distorted by slight tendency csars best example was though sometimes coloured by his slipshod as language his historical insight which famous comprehend literature competent literature without being rarest kindthe scholar who exact as language without failing he was for he has all characteristics scholar best he has left few positive documents tell us but i should think as accomplished classical scholar as he claimed be i do not know approaching new facets so immense whether he was truth suspicion what de quincey will say on any subject his gift sighting large measure you never quite know though you may have shrewd observable few if any have indefinable quality freshness so desire for knowledge for argument which age cannot quench more themselves none incurable curiosity infinite variety more likely lead his readers on explore think for this for other reasons no writer has more stimulating

born riotous spirits often sits always save on very exceptional subjects been ungraceful even on be aware style was becoming as unfashionable as had quincey himself after lived too little touch actual life at least did not seem interfere their popularity de deliberately imported this element horseplay into literature coteries connexion whom de quincey started as writerhad not few writers london magazinethe two literary yet fair remember wilson blackwood set together particular qualities not always virtues or graces they have not relations life not least literature assume most odd law human nature which constantly prompts people various as joe magliabecchi as mag may be only new example this kind should think both allowable funny talk josephus much flattered was somewhat aghast at his punctilio man fathers cook as if she had been duchess cook though wilsons daughter mrs gordon says he used address her courtliness which marked de quinceys colloquial style expression authorities agree as exceptional combination scholarliness know i should protest habit more curious all any one else denounced as breach good literary manners i do not had called excessively silly i should have agreed heartily if knowing nothing particularly sacred about josephus but if mr masson bargain positively profane i am not sure as profanity joe through whole article give him black eye into propitiate enemy admits address historian josephus as jocularity which he only too often exhibits mr masson trying remains be noticed this altogether deplorable notion one other curious weakness his which has been glanced at already  let us say cicero must be better than swift english your ornate writer must be better than your plain one ergo de quincey fell through an unswervingness deduction more french than literary side matter blind his otherwise piercing literary sight where hazlitt went wrong from letting prejudices unconnected autobiography went wrong from not having enough general principle selfillumination more instructive than reams imaginative friend i have had as he somewhere says halfpathetic touch happened get way where wilson only intimate male downwards from them which case woe any individual fact or person he was constantly constructing general principles then arguing logical disposition mind was rather snare him his criticism presently general may be said de quinceys extremely connected his special willworship ornate style which more gave german rank great poetic tongues his severity on swift rather only matched by heine language by which goethe first character mentions not single one those lyrics unmatched or agreed about sentences egmont as violating historic truth work dismisses faust as something no two people have ever everything came after for mere power goethes paramount deliberately assents opinion werther superior faust egmont above all shorter poems here he have written article encyclopdia britannica on author indeed at very height his literary powers practice he should taste tediousness but not excusable much later two worst characteristics german life literature bad goethe at his best who acknowledge most fully presence wilhelm wilhelm meister quite excusable there are fervent admirers his unpardonable treatment goethe he should have maltreated dissertations his want appreciation may supply explanation poetical condition he speaks very little all his extensive critical lyrical poetry generally say poetry its most purely quality he says nothing if he knew or felt anything fact thinker distorted but interesting shelleys strictly poetical not too hard on him any way he thinks him pleasing personality sentiment our modern chatterers from puritanical preciseness he shelley as man admirably freedom alike from maudlin interesting paper which late life he devoted shelley he treats philosophical poets pope even certain way but read shakespeare inasmuch as he perceived shakespeare be greatest poetry as poetry he liked philosophical poetsmilton wordsworth heretical some people whether de quincey really cared much for idiosyncrasy i doubt very much though doubt may seem horribly prejudice as hazlitts case but apparently some perverse quinceys part enormities due not accidental casual crotchet or follow this up long list critical enormities on de if not as thinker above plato would be not only possible but easy what be thought man who evidently sets cicero as writer thanvelleius paterculus suppose this be mere fling or freak paganism had no more brilliant master composition show least asserting himself be no mean classical scholarwho declares appeal know what be done professed critic styleat are not much read now but there must be sufficient jury whom i can competent critics on whole negatives minor classical writers my own but critical opinions which general consent blundersby which i mean course not critical opinions disagreeing responsible for singularly large number singularly grave critical critic books cannot be met quite so directly he indeed other charge he was bad or rather very untrustworthy  indifference whether he wounded or not i do not believe either deliberate intention wound or deliberate he was any proper sense spiteful say he ever wrote fond personal talk which wordsworth wisely disdained but occur him he was perhaps for very similar reason rather too wrote far too much as one another planet for anything kind which has been made for him above inconsistent he always ought i give paini do not allege fact very excuse he ever said himself will what i am writing give pain cases he was what called thoughtful personthat say coleridges life was entitled say if he chose so other than any man who knew then little but now wellknown facts charges i do not see de quincey said anything worse coleridge ancient mariner kubla khan are no defence particular denounce coleridge for these proceedings may surely hold for trip azores rest us though we may feel no call who were not prepared at moments notice give him hundred pounds his next friend mr wordsworth other benefactors like thomas poole take stipends from casual benefactors scold by himself or by leave his wife children be looked after by anybody who chose wrote ancient mariner kubla khan he was quite entitled foolish folk has recently arisen which tells us because coleridge against magnificent genius but most unsatisfactory man sort brother opiumeating against confessions told some home truths services by doubtless sincere but rather unctuous protest his unprovoked by scant gratitude on coleridges part for very solid reach reasondoubt wordsworths arrogance was inhuman he not arrogant does anybodynot being wordsworthian therefore out malice he called his literary idol wordsworth inhumanly further has yet be proved de quincey set down anything this not triumphant defence no doubt but i think defence move within earshot jostle their fellows on this actual earth himself he could hardly feel restraints press on those who character mens speech vacant interlunar caves where he hid friction society his utterances hardly partake ordinary all places so thoroughly excluded from natural contact hardly treated he led such wholly unnatural life he was at all times unamiable or not but i think de quincey has this respect been once dead matters uncommonly little whether he was personally carlyle would not any case concern us much for when man corroborated endorsed by persons as different as southey this latter charge has found wide acceptance has been practically  books other he very spiteful commentator on men not fully espouse either them he an untrustworthy critic on different lines thought one objection i should say i do despatch two other objections made him from different quarters order we may see what he desirable first all best nowhere else exists but he much more than mere schoolmaster bring youths promise not merely good literature but once more as an elaborate pompous sunset such schoolmaster mannered beauty his finest stylethe style quote his own words minds seventeen they are quite able comprehend great if on without minding where he going anything but repugnant brisk words getting into logical coaches letting himself be carried most respected professor northern university may recognise intelligible his worst not wholly uncongenial his habit certain clever schoolboy appeal directly his best fun quite little pedantries which day his death were like those extraordinary ignorance daily life does not revolt youth his had been applied any one but himself what he somewhere calls his fantastic nomenclature which he would have himself appreciated if instructor sons prophets he might be called singular priceless one master court gentiles or has been already noted his extraordinary attraction for youth spare some much more faultless writers even quality his which from most assuredly all who love english literature would sooner assuredly no man who loves english literature could spare de quincey my own experience felt more seriously at each successive reading most yet though these drawbacks are grave though they are judge from  de quincey fail do should be getting too serious or too tedious what richter second never fails keep watchful eye on himself lest he anything can be but author first place never loses his way swift tale tub appearance as daringly discursive as appreciate mistake only necessary compare manner still greater degree this same habit quasiserious divagation been considerable has always been lessened by presence him say i confess my own enjoyment richter which has nevertheless century whom he became acquainted very early i should not like influence jean paul other german humorists last justice called scholastic manner how much this was due reason quite gravely away from what not entirely he almost invariably lost sight basis proceeded generally humorous basis for these divagations de quinceys but refine little i should say there was very frequently if not each other by such apparently impermeable lines as humour if i may so many subdivisions or which subdivisions are marked off from seem surprising but fact there are few things which there are his own performances this author essay on murder may except balzac victor hugo was so insensible ludicrous aspect on whole i should say no great man letters this century his letters young man whose education has been neglected believe he was excessively annoyed at lambs delightful parody susceptible being made fun said we can very well never seems suspect his own general attitude at least studded quips jests good bad indifferent but writer almost if not quite unconsciously these digressions or deviations are out by application most sensitive tests quite seriously very remarkable thing he rigmaroles so far as can be made other rigmaroler despite his undoubted possession kind humour quincey has carried point perfection never reached by any rigmarole however can be very agreeable thing its way de  narrative are most certainly rigmarole which gradually diffusedly set down

whether bishop would have some remarks on relative status oxford colleges then he great length who bishop was how he was head brasenose laughter our appetites longing for more de quincey tells us at

contemporary writer whom we can expostulate but he proceeds instead consider possible effect on bishop he meditated expostulation language he did not very angry as he thought he could write greek much

exactly like his articles those astonishing imaginary quinceys conversation which have been printed his letters which are any such but both printed works remembrances de remark was not applied any unfriendly spirit nor adduced here delightful qualities kind rigmarole so far as i remember masson or not i hardly know was many interesting conversation which i have seen quoted somewhere whether by professor this peculiarity best hinted at remark on de quinceys find description at once accurate fair brief adequate dwarf obscure differences subject not very easy political economy had one characteristic so strongly impressed on as or reminiscence literary criticism or historical study politics or excepting them everything de quincey wrote whether was dream prose which are stuck all about work perhaps strictness not but truth except those wonderful purple patches numerous tried made rather muddle professor masson trying also myself whether any classification necessary de quincey himself much classify not particularly easy i doubt accomplished especially when considered how extraordinarily good still what we have no mean bulk work for any man have  fourteen or sixteen or sixty printed volumes would more nearly express its amount than we had all he actually wrote during these nearly forty years forty made considerable inroads on his leisure but i should imagine if refashioning previously executed work also illness opium time especially his last years all rewriting was always writing course true he spent great deal man except when he was sleeping wandering about or reading he so logical thinker as an ordinary newspaper article by an ordinary writing was kind almost as easily written by so full reader was his habit bestow himself greater part de quinceys always leaving deposits his manuscripts various lodgings where smaller part what he actually wrote he was always writing were acquainted him during his later years must have been but from de quinceys own assertions from observations those who increased but this printed reprinted total so far as can be judged lesser number contents each volume have been very considerably though new edition promises restrict itself older fourteen volumes collection was subsequently enlarged sixteen publication was very large as collected by author filled time when de quincey first began unusually late write for quantity work produced during this singular existence from  theory masterpassion so often abused justified itself here books would certainly either have committed suicide or gone mad popes de quincey world where there was neither reading nor writing nothing else was natural at all books he always at home him one tempted say reading writing did come by nature impersonal at once delighted talk resolutely shunning society but apparently natural fated de quincey was at once egotistic his impenetrabilityan impenetrability not least due posing character from his works few persons who met him all agree as his character for once almost impossible discover little as recorded facts his life even less recorded period he knew was known not few distinguished men but recognised as great name

now such questions always difficult but especially difficult here will estimate if different be higher or lower answer known older editions for quarter century have formed will they form different estimate from which those us who have  thoroughly subject scholar who has taken great deal pains acquaint himself americans have yet had they will have edited by an accomplished before them fuller completer edition de quincey than even ways still actual generation readers will undoubtedly have dislocation his arrangement which has also been neglected other de quinceys redaction altogether always confusion thrust into or between separate essays sometimes destruction supplementary volumes or appendices reprinted volumes but his own arrangement has taken place new matter being not added like what i cannot but regard as rather unceremonious tampering say still further stinted matter print margins mechanical producers books has had his sizings as byron would not very much like this last edition de quincey never much favoured by acknowledgment mr massons services english literature i do de quincey professor masson i may say hearty definitive edition from english critic who has given most attention much praying readers grumbling critics we have fifth shorter half his extraordinary yet uneventful life now after occupied him for about same period say for last portion his strange longdelayed but voluminous work this work had mainput before british public for some thirtyfive years certain rabbins turned out more soberly clad but identical another reprinted little

getting attributed him any accessible form had thus attributed him work was not his he has also had critic accustomed be positive on internal evidence but if de quincey salathiel crolys must have given unpleasant qualms more than one such length time was not de quinceys at all but de quinceyish indeed was so de quinceyish discovery after end time certainly traditions rabbins was very twenty

even very good poet or taleteller i have no doubt whatever but hardly stand i have given my reasons he was neither great man may be good critic bad reviewer though reverse will i have said i do not think he was on whole good critic for work according standard which author himself strove reach addressing oneself great question good or bad piece instead expounding more or less clearly what book

happy one not  themselves mistake but further when we come speak noctes when happened be mixed others seems me have been original attempt give wilsons work only not all work cutanddried are nearly unintelligible indeed professor ferriers unless he reads as whole its humours arbitrarily separated my judgment successful no one can really taste eccentric book author thalatta process not at least speaking according skipping done ready hand but all respect due tried make comedy noctes ambrosian which eyes warnings wilson not for him true mr skelton has eye not wary enough or if his conscience forbids him obey his tastes skip discretion vigour if he cannot do this if his numerous altitudes will behove reader according his own when he begins wax pathetic when he gets into many others his well versed art skipping when wilson begins talk fine he who will enjoy him must be an intelligent voluptuary especially very high indeed so high he can be ranked only below highest chapters here partly an effort literary hedonism wilson stands which be got from literature this like one or two other these are grave faults but for purpose providing pleasure  pass next moment into hatred or liking as case might be liking hatred quite uncordinated by no means unlikely hated wrong ones but was for most part merely instinctive being healthy creature he on whole liked right things politics or literature he liked he hated much strongly fund principles putting morals religion aside either bottom which carlyle notes i do not think wilson had any solid other faults nothing seems me so much responsible as want high treason or at least leasingmaking as well as for all wilsons criticism done which crime for these acts literary wordsworth or shakespeare may not be criticised way which need hardly be said i have no intention saying scott or  when wilson his ugly moods frequently assailed even shakespeare does not come off scotfree only fling at scott wordsworth much more vulnerable also much more friend deeply obliged friend such as wilson nor this fortunes might have protected him even from an enemy much more from written published at time when sir walters known state health this carping offensive criticism scotts demonology most disgraceful perhaps only really disgraceful instance dramatic touch intentionally administered him by his eidolon north more kindly than wisely

kicks many men things there no more unpleasant feature noctes what his censor elsewhere describes as his habit giving kick punch least attractive point about wilsons work undoubtedly charitable suggesting missing link was supplied by whisky off phrase want tiebeam whether he has or has not been idiosyncrasy great characteristic which carlyle has happily hit noticed they were due beyond doubt wilsons case natural inelegance style but he need never commit any faults just writing against time may be driven dulness or commonplace or burlesque more tedious jactation which disfigure his work man puerilities touches bad taste false pathos tedious monththis prodigious haste would not itself account for contributed from hundred hundred fifty pages single two days years its double numbers he often one occasion actually written fiftysix pages print for blackwood inconceivable haste which he wrote he credited having on written good pages sense pages good throughout almost he had written good pages but no good book only very rarely has he even diderot he must bear harder version judgment on diderot can endure if be judged by any severe test an english incomplete true enough wilson has written intrinsically nothing thomas yet criticism if partly harsh as whole somewhat thomas judged him somewhat summarily as if he were failure thou but himself other than thou john was quite other than thomas critics usual forgetfulness his own admirable dictum he not something unfavourable part this must no doubt be set down  can endure central gift was wanting then or still yet intrinsically he has written nothing me always by far most gifted our literary men either whisky punch on these terms nothing can be done wilson seems bottomthat was my old figure speechonly by an ocean luxuriance leaf flower but knit together at volcanic tumults rocks overgrown indeed tropical hence being all split into precipitous chasms wildest strong enough vanquish perverse element born into total incredulity noble loyal religious nature not contradictions toryism sansculottism methodism sort long ago i perceived him most irreconcilable genius but central tiebeam seemed wanting always very

journeying comforts wine vetturini instance penniless or pedestrian manner he visited st apprenticeship are very considerably exaggerated was not for impartial while biographically speaking hardships

edinburgh review vol london this following remarks reference confined  then three then one contributions edinburgh review appeared first four volumes prevent mistakes may be as well say jeffreys  footnotes  critics which are hardly be matched among fluctuating diverse race coordinates its bearings on other things seen precision unable see but what he does see he sees clearness he does not see there may be some things which he physically has seen so many seeming heavy things grow light there may be much jeffreys critical judgments are after three quarters century which little more equity little less law astonishing how weighty seem carp complain however much we may sometimes wish for exercise judicial function but however much he may sometimes invariably sound not quite so much perhaps can be said for his other worried counsel little too much but his decisions were almost attributed academic criticism they said on actual bench he no means justly chargeable dryasdust failings so often eccentricity must be again again repeated jeffrey by soundness estimate intelligent connection view absence who have thus outstripped him when subject trial shifted frequently be found wanting but he almost invariably catches up those sympathy tested for range alone or for subtlety alone he will sympathy an extraordinary shrewdness good sense applying them his strength lies combination fairly wide range undiscovered countries nor provokes stimulates discovery critical columbus nor critical socrates he neither opens up very profound or very original views his subjects he neither not as coleridge hazlitt or lamb very subtle important us let me repeat then peculiar value jeffrey saintebeuve said altered jeffrey our altered days are remarks on his general characteristics especially those which as there were room enough but i have only space for few more general there are many essays remaining on which i should like comment if  disgust us those gross faults style metre phrase form which now for his edifying but rather irrelevant moral denunciations some exposure as seems some later critics he would at any rate have substituted pronounce byrons sentiment be as theatrical as vulgar as false done so impossible not believe whether he did or did not tests solvents which few men have had greater command had he he never seems have had leisure or courage apply critical calls dreadful tone sincerity this puissant spirit advantage former he so completely overcome by what he going so far as actually contrast manfred marlowe contagion which he denounces by talking about byrons demoniacal power dear mat prior he helps unconsciously no doubt spread very staunchest champion must admit applies glorious john particular word can be applied byron at all while even his prior which simply ludicrous because very rare this almost absurd he calls him not more obscene perhaps than dryden or sincerely rebuking byrons morality doing so he sometimes unnecessarily great deal time solemnly no doubt quite rebuked by his subject he spends great deal surely an noble poet as they used call him have felt his genius unduly seems rather numerous articles which he has devoted conceited rubbish are not me very satisfactory critic hours idleness which was simply just rebuke really puerile jeffreys dealings byron i do not now speak article on  stars seemed him puerile conceited sane who could put his hand on his heart deny little century unless perchance was grard de nerval he was not quite not believe there ever was frenchman since seventeenth rest passage but there you have french spirit i do  take him cut him out little stars  unmatchable sympathy such conceits puerilities as immortal jeffreys own limitations he should protest against hazlitts acuteness just enough on other hand how significant its hinted condemnation hazlitts desultory capricious shakespeare if not on hazlitt would be impossible deny better i could do myself yet contains some admirable passages on who observes see this clever boy mine only think how much napier about carlyle but something spirit schoolmaster mistaken kind which induced famous unlucky sentence macvey little defaced by patronising spirit not indeed memorably generosity on jeffreys part towards his wayward contributor his biographer not jeffreys has chronicled remarkable piece characters shakespeare hazlitt was an edinburgh reviewer place an anthology his critical beauties paper on hazlitts style our elizabethan dramatists which would deserve almost first so well together some remarks on magnificently spendthrift english literature which jeffrey was so fond doing which he did edition ford another those critical surveys course above on campbells specimens here criticism webers things which deserve reading here remarkable essay quoted rocks offence already indicated here also are many excellent considerable divisions headed poetry fiction here are chief historical so forth but reader will naturally turn instances are be found under miscellaneous sections biographical at time now so apparently moderate against poetic diction these found his general description cowpers revolt thought so daring cowper i have already given some weakness strength be unmixed examples his weakness be found his essays on thing another excellent example jeffreys strength by no means tory triumph after waterloo ready admit fact not trivial have not but find whig whig writing very moment probably never been equalled any period world they certainly view purposes for which they were intended they have inconsiderable period government england considered he says are perhaps only literary works ever really changed for not marlborough administrative talents godolphin which libels if any one likes which proved too strong for generalship tub but also those wonderful pamphlets articles lampoons skits he likes greatest least positively unjust tale curious illustrates his defective appreciation humour jeffreys description not merely great works just mentioned sound literary judgment over political personal prejudice than very odd indeed but there are few instances greater triumph tale tub gulliver polite conversation remarks on swift himself for instance deny fancy author which jeffrey according his custom prefixes particular also find things seem be errors both general sketch style addison swift tame poor possible course here means fanatical admirer augustan age thought serious writings especially since as has been elsewhere shown he was by no have been tempted extend his injustice from writer value his literary criticism shows itself he might very easily conduct character seems both uncritical unfair but here too trial me at any rate his account swifts political moral subject perhaps jeffrey does not come quite scatheless out on scotts edition swift here again there was kind test censures another essay which may be read especial advantage therefore arguing tongue understanded those whom he proportion which at bottom french mistake because he he himself largely penetrated by very preference for order romantique tous crins because as has been already pointed out especially admirable because they are not made from point view can be more admirable than jeffreys comments on this matter they are english writers especially english humorists generally nothing dungheap idea not merely reference shakespeare but frenchman who his heart hearts does not cling old pearls grown flourished i believe very rarest thing find mm taine montgut study english literature generally has fashion france admire shakespeare though since labours great extent on contrary though has long been kind romantic movement france has done away this imputation english very general very mistaken notion want taste politeness english german writers especially better than jeffreys discussion general french imputation henriade second but hardly anything english criticism him genius almost as author iliad does from author donne moreover who wrote long before cowley was born differs from against critical blunder which couples cowley donne putting asunder we may protest against chronological even more than deny coarseness aristophanes vulgarity are certainly many miles living pundit thinks him base while though nobody course can agree jeffrey he thinks aristophanes coarse vulgar just as which however much we admit jeffrey was clever man we cannot contains course there are here as always isolated expressions as few general sketches history literature which his work connection also her he gives one best not perfectibilism put order her rather rash literary judgments contrives take good corinne pieces smash up her ingenious instructive observe how intervals these compliments he course profuse compliments but very amusing highly her lifetime under influences just glanced at he three essays appearing collected works writing at least partly him accordingly he has written great deal about her no less than tastes must have made her or at least her books specially attractive life english whig party general while jeffreys french kind goddess on earth literature however much she might bore them lady whom some judges these days do not think very much was stands first his collected works on madame de stal now good measure than most all good critics literary essay which through again see those qualities which he shares but greater less favourable characteristics which distinguish his position look let us as we just now looked through jeffreys work pick out  criticism critical authority if there has been any such author essays graces which marred some tastes work his successor wilson he never indulges mannered rather superfluous faculty carlyle he never blusters splashes at random like preach on certain pet subjects which affects admirable critical object which de quincey seldom does he not affected by desire thousand miles off course true criticism he keeps his eye on gusts personal political passion which frequently blew hazlitt lockhart prejudiced as he often was he was not affected by wild himself more directly theoretically literary criticism than perhaps very best example we have english he had addressed this dogmatic criticism jeffrey all his shortcomings  connect them into some coherent doctrine creed least tries keep its impressions together order needs chastening by an admixture dogmatic criticism which at rampant so good work as has done its time decidedly was his day only its infancy has long been full grown he was his own for spirit merely sthetic criticism which critic he important at this very day perhaps more important than subject almost exclusively historical interest while as literary where can be managed besides jeffrey as political critic his political criticism but always best keep politics out especially as literary critic would be interesting criticise hazlitts are be compared his merits as critic though considerable are not be compared even extent which himself but very small fault yet his merits as an essayist abstracting or paraphrasing where he speaking outright for skill this respect makes rather difficult know where he are be found his reviews sometimes very perfection his are often remembered very indistinct consciousness their origin phrases which have made most mark general memory which interesting books literature passages traits anecdotes books which he has reviewed he has reviewed many most best proof his felicity this respect almost all englishmen art interweaving quotation abstract comment writer causeries i do not think he has been surpassed among for jeffrey most admirable essayist critic as an essayist kept up by few though very few reviewers have been further allowed affectation delivering judgments without appeal which still clearly discovered marked out when some little tricks such as but when these reservations have been made when his standpoint has been  generation go shares any newcomer literary commerce curious reluctance as lamb has another great man same tendency regard novelty as bad merely because novelty by unfortunately distorted by certain absence catholicity by literary orthodoxy freedom from willworship eccentric divagations say very just wholesome preference for order proportion are almost exactly same as case usual frenchman protesting against tarte la crme reasons for his error he quite certain shocking jeffrey but too much given even produce any important authority for shockingness but unable say why tarte la crme such shocking expression or saintebeuve who habitually free from them critic may be quite day there perhaps not one single exception school before but almost all french critics up present reason are eminently gallic they may be found not merely older such thing as low improper without assigned or assignable wholly arbitrary canon mere taste these excommunicatings such his own condemnation his own frame mind these settingsup him he must have seen words were ludicrously applicable his deficiency which for all his keen wit another gallic note flat burglary if jeffrey had had little more sense humour fun thing passage turns on wellknown misuse shakespearian parallel foxs seems him downright impropriety familiar too low vapid while harmless rather agreeable illtreating these appear mr aristarchus jeffrey too homely phrases as swearing away lives crying injustice fond fox so he unhappy rather than contemptuous over such excellent no worth he was certainly not likely be unjust charles james him entreat him peace this wrangler here like fellow achilles calm evidently he had forgotten shakespeares pursue cowpers use his translation homer phrases entreat criticism he was great admirer cowper yet he shocked by characteristics pseudocorrect pseudoclassical school as vulgar other as unbecoming which are condemnation those capricious stigmatisings this as improper writers we find him slipping into those purely arbitrary severities his own contemporaries sometimes even reference earlier too severe on french as compared english drama yet when he comes fanatic school hazlitt or lamb he if anything rather older english literature phrases which might almost satisfy question whether pope was poet as i have said he uses about little inclined sympathise reverend mr bowles on great his early course independent reading criticism he was even romantic up certain pointthe point which he had himself reached scandalise later voltairians jeffrey was perfectly prepared be only little less than they would have scandalised voltaire did its undoubted offences against order proportion scandalised him alternate homeliness extravagance its abuse supernatural disposed faults taste german romantic school its disposed feel but as matter fact he was not at all world almost too soon feel german impulse even if he had been were still more decidedly unquestionably french he came into literature especially criticism jeffreys characteristics  disasters country there may be thought be no small cause political military temperament france indeed

jeffrey be pronounced most jeffreys mind character as horace walpole has been pronounced back seems me lie what i can only call gallicanism as hume says another matter only push ignorance stage farther explanation as far as there any perhaps such explanations  character even his purely political arguments appear if not quite so strongly his estimates personal limited should be said purely literary criticism they jeffrey will discover them plenty for himself but they are not be content take them for granted reader who does read because reader who does not want trouble reading jeffrey must poems he partly admired unnecessary multiply inconsistencies wordsworth himself yet sneer at very finest passages saw printed quarto volume who could really appreciate parts even am not very fond animal as whole very worst poem he ever opinion moore pronounce white doe rylstone though i splendid strains moore though i have myself relatively high thank him for word about dancing daffodils who could talk essays on mme de stal campbell yet be guilty stuff we who could write admirable surveys english poetry contained standpoint man whose judgment was at once so acute so purblind therefore discover define if possible critical ever said anything but what he sincerely thought problem emphasising or softening his opinions i do not think he frequently have determined suppression or utterance his sincere conviction on contrary though partisanship may phrases as stuff about dancing daffodils he was speaking away from these things or when he actually perpetrated such almost

volume indeed would not for him volume composed kilmeny best write all by himself as children say then we could make up never be overlooked if hogg some lucky moment did really very best things its kind claim which ought overdone which very difficult indeed do well but one confessions book style which wearies soon if be same interest hogg if he were not putative author at any rate i confess for myself i should not take anything like  think there good critical reason for while nature things even less capable disproof but i course hypothesis which very unlikely ever be proved off he set apparently little store by book only hypothesis explains at same time why for shepherds vanity was never far whole explains why he wished lockhart edit others his work such excellent flashes so flawed formless as training gives us useful interesting explanation why mass shepherds genius could turn out when submitted correction novels suffer rather for want if this be one specimen what chiefly hoggs for lockharts forte was not quality his own hardship i should think actual imagination story question his right her but i do not think there any real may seem rather hard after praising mans ewe lamb so highly  as any one its members society which he lived affected which he carried as far at least perhaps something habit literary supercherie which much from vanity or dishonesty as from simple carelessness dashed editing or collaboration if did take place not nearly so hogg himself he would never have thought acknowledging any such shepherds views literary morality were peculiar as for when his wrath over foolish blethering about scott he wrote noise though he may have thought this as well as other things have been man claim share book even had made more ascertain what he did or did not write unassisted would certainly not his work this day difficult if not impossible writing two men will deny lockhart who was so careless faults boar forestnobody who knows undoubted his own polished mannerto weed shape correct straighten sinnerto give hoggs loose though by no means vulgar style dress disorderly luxuriance into methodical madness justified exactly thing necessary prune train direct shepherds perhaps something more than editing on lockharts part would have been different kind as confessions themselves editing itself history lunatic as full horrors those no very presbyterian minister are dwelt upon matthew wald which adam blair where terrors temptations convinced residence at chiefswood lockhart produced little masterpiece but worked at this very same time was these very years his identical vein which lockhart not only worked on his own account vein confessions very closely akin if not wholly discouraging which plan he was very cross sir walter further lockhart should edit all his shepherds works for tells us book on scott how he had plan even later than this him his autobiography as warm disinterested friend he hoaxed him as he hoaxed everybody warm his praise he describes allies hogg while admitting author peters letters long afterwards lockhart was one closest hoggs literary actually figures postscript book now at this time for coincidences probabilities has been seen lockharts name by way answer these questions i can at least point out certain  can be no doubt who saved himfor great part book at least his there should he on this particular occasion have been saved from himself he failed except this instance as often as he tried why what not relinquishes hogg was always trying supernatural man once tries particular style then from accident disgust or unadulterated unassisted work not one those cases where at same time i am absolutely unable believe hoggs biographers have never so far as i know hinted least hesitation not so much as mention her memorials but his various representatives any reason doubt now his daughter i think does doubted then was his nor i have been told have their though book had been failure his publishers do not seem have any attempt shift divide or any way disclaim responsibility was particularly valuable or meritorious thing claim without not only without hesitation but apparently without any suspicion admitting appeared anonymously hogg claims as we have seen have found some good judges not unwilling agree me although authorship though since i myself entertained doubts on

crabbe not distinctly eulogists either discreetly avoid saying what they mean by which mr kebbel quotes those he does not quote i observe evidence he produced this effect on them both eulogies gelid critic i do not discover even crabbes warmest admirers any be patient search poetical stimulant becoming merely instances produces this effect on me what more on ceasing now i can only say crabbe does not produce or only rarest  production some part laws though not ultimate complete causes by much study different times different languages recognise say but they do chief merit criticism enables us assisted by meaning produce this effect poetry on men no man can should almost without aid meaning though no doubt immensely mysterium why certain combinations letters sounds cadences matters are worth handling at all we come course ad kind somewhat lower commoner less this matter as all we hear same quality music informing words though again  bleeding from roman rods when british warrior queen  schoolboys favourite disadvantageously contrasts crabbe when we read old romantic poets this case from poet whom mr kebbel specially alike struck for ever yet again take example still from less there another note as different as possible kind yet still  placed far amid melancholy main so when shepherd hebrid isles  at peaches hears him between mouthfuls murmuring he sees thomson his hands

no less person than mr john morley there one note added he sees quite independently meaning which disturbs  eternal silence our noisy years seem moments being  platitude but when any one who knows what poetry reads wordsworthians admit write most detestable doggerel wordsworth can as everybody but wordsworthians holds as some even get some music married even moderate meaning you get say moore married best meaning then you get say shakespeare when you sounds superadded meaning when you get best music music verse words cadence rhythm something which transports something my view always very highest as well as very lowest still poetry there this where i go beyond hazlitt there no music all poetry no wing crabbe there no transport because as i hold joubertthat lyre winged instrument must transport there one truest all dicta on poetry famous maxim defect crabbe as seems me best indicated by reference  not poetry literal shakespeare so picture gloucesters corpse i think myself poet if he poet could be almost absolutely one things which make poesis non ut pictura not all selecting instead giving all as hazlitt himself justly contends would have been worse verse i think not although faculty bard twickenham grossly exaggerated this but suppose he had not as conquering instance pope compare crabbe we know single out as hazlitt expressly does deathbed scene buckingham i do not know any one less hardy than hazlitt himself would him there dante i think was sometimes quite as minute as crabbe seems have thought had everything do i do not quite agree are not wanted has no doubt great deal do thishazlitt at universal absence selection discarding details individual never do you reach large freedom poet who looks poetical way you are bound shallows miseries steadily even way he sees whole but he does not see than poetic photographic rather than pictorial he sees his subject mere treatment goes fault crabbe he pictorial rather show an instant but he has indicated right line as far as hazlitt true has not followed up attack as i shall hope have been pleased understand for last generation or two white at once wounds crabbe mortally demolishes realism as we description pope as showing things poetical point view hits striking for heaven knows crabbe often striking enough but one flaws which hazlitt rarely avoided use word even here i have not been able quote whole passage there  view imagination you see what was passing poetical point have described merely what was there pope there was an appeal can be more dissimilar pope describes what striking crabbe would crabbe justified himself by popes example nothing says hazlitt by touch weakest part whole ruperts drop misapprehension here again one those critical taps finger which shivers most famous certainly best passages late mr arnold teasing helpless unimaginative distress germ one here couple lines they turn one all on same sort tirade which alone might show how great critic hazlitt himself was which critic devotes poet but there are two passages this accordingly there much untrue tissue denunciation inconvenient things hazlitt was author liber amoris squeamish most unvoluptuous dispassionate all describers torified into tame variety again crabbe though by no means not seem have thought him so liberal but his liberalism had been loathed dukes he had been radical was still though hazlitt does church england he had been dukes chaplain hazlitt clergyman church england hazlitt did not love clergymen successful man hazlitt did not like successful men he was unjust much explicably not too creditably unjust crabbe was brief space six or eight pages which he allots crabbe considering any judgment hazlitts much he says even here urge at very great length cautions which are always necessary hazlitts criticism on crabbe spirit age i need not men our fathers were before us i have already referred habit summingup introduce if possible dictum famous thus putting question we may try sum up gracious  discussed old form asking was crabbe poet certain precedent i cannot help stating case which we have into genius he all this more but despite warnings way not tried by others may thus be very fairly said turn immense talent he has originality which sets talent work likeare not worse than miltons jokes on guns he has  were once my motive now thoughts want alas your reverence wanton

balzac thackeray or one great russian novelists honour mr james sully if we compare says mr sully fielding for passage signed by person whom i name altogether for sake because passage which i read while this essay was awriting mere eddyingsround same circle i am tempted glance at this some absolute progress life art instead for most part himself from besetting error which makes men believe there only by dint this constant comparison can critic save  footnotes  accumulation i shall have done which i purposed have these essays contributed even very little such an sufficient corpus really critical discussion individuals if i seen may be doubted whether there even yet accumulated as body criticism socalled which last hundred years have as definition poetry or kinds limits novel large digression argue at length upon abstract general questions such advisable except as matter necessary but very occasional these essays sketch life subject nor has seemed private crotchet accordingly some space has been given most whatever about his life but mere private opinion possibly every author merit i should care little know anything no harm them for myself i should like have whole works they are not allowed shoulder out criticism altogether there can be same time biographical anecdotic details please most people if those which criticism least useful or least satisfactory at shakespeare or only few leading facts as dante are not examples which we know practically nothing at all as than generally thought rare instances throws light but less do real appreciation literary value an author some extent biographical anecdotic detail has i believe much even say i have knowingly intentionally come short them have come very far short my own ideal my own precepts i may following pages i shall no doubt be found like other people  response perpetual why quare stans criticism are at any rate easier than fashioning some intelligent intelligible flowers rhetoric fruits wit may not be easy but they naughty wit has pleasant chatter about personal reminiscences whom they never thought they could possibly be introduced as certain agreeable exercises style where adjectives meet substantives other literary matter not only easier writing but also easier reading criticism are recommended by fact they are unlike some theres an end all imperfect kinds as they seem me sometimes be actually forced say jaime mieux alfred de musset faith you no doubt critic will often be tempted will effect some way without giving something like reason for lastly never be content without at least endeavouring connect cause  forms hares or leafinsects disguising themselves by simulating literary these enemies for extraliterary prejudices are as cunning as winter classic or romantic very difficult indeed chase discovery down miracles do not happen as an englishman or frenchman fervent or acquiescent supernatural or as person who lays uneasy antiaristocrat for uneasy antiaristocrats as believer his having written as gentleman for gentlemen or as an taken care whig dogs or tory dogs shall not have best say admiration for author not due his having extraliterary character matter under examination make sure what you like dislike literary not second i think always make sure as far as you possibly can  compare always compare first axiom criticism appreciations coleridge hazlitt saintebeuve mr arnold boileau simpletons like rymer be compared fullest unrhymed let straitest doctrinaire criticism men talent like compared poets new classics romantics rhymed greeks romans bring out other let poets old days be set differences foreigners modern times bring out englishmen be compared englishmen other times bring out this himself mr dash himself all languages all times let too large number instances all degrees merit from aeschylus mr dash answering will hardly be possible consider inquiry as what i really do like agamemnon do dislike be constantly put be answered only by pretty close personal agamemnon dislike mr dashs fiveact tragedy question disliking same comparative fashion why do i like refer back his sensations agreement disagreement liking position be laid down next place he must i think constantly comparative study different languages literatures first reviewing all cases critic must start from wide times all languages would not be found merest casual if narrow inquiry were made some best criticism all both require same qualities same outfit nor am i certain criticism classics should proceed on same lines i think endeavoured point out criticism contemporary work contemporary work this volume i think however as i have just this however one sense digression for there no criticism  though they often failed appreciate fully present laureates faults they were seldom severe on their goodness critics were severe on byrons faults on keatss faults on been attacked even shadow success for its goodness really good thing even most famous or infamous attacks on one few things we have discovered very rarely has any not good second case has been discovered late say this book not popular most he intended was this book case nothing was probably farther from critics intention than skies both as generally urged rest on fallacy first more uncommon remark than other they slated you extol book you slated this has gone through twenty editions not cannot certainly for present sell or prevent sale critic major or critic minor saintebeuve or mr gall cannot do he there are no doubt certain things critic whether he be world at large which apparently not hurry decide either way useless encumbrances must be questions left decision whether reviewer critic are valuable members society or  not be good reviews critics but then all these things may be done done well yet apollos last book may do all these things well not be good columns on general theory poetry when he professes review mr intelligent compterendu man person who writes six enduring literature writer funny articles slater was not posse or esse good critic highest most sure there never was good reviewer even lowest trash who ephemeral work but i do not think they were better for this i am critics who were unable bring themselves down mere reading at not above its relative value whole there have been good defects enough general knowledge estimate particular subject everything who has enough special knowledge not miss merits or platonic or pseudoplatonic philosopher who second best worth reading he who more or less approximates this ideal perfect reviewer would be only reviewer whose reviews are great charlemagne or vice vers he constantly out focus does not decide offhand man hopeless because he calls charles much experience can go even if he has no special craze or megrim always worst but about as far as my charity informed by specialist best reviewer i do not say he worst known me though shared by some who should know better as logrolling craze fivepound note craze like common mistakes on subject which are not merely silly crazes such work possible given one most important kinds work reviewers which by whom errors accidents excepted best little gentle exercise i know not few papers not few trained brokendown hacks turned out grass invalids allowed reviews were sort exercisingground on which novices were manager be allotted devils as good him seemed many where i own scarcely credible where whole reviewing was farmed out shelf or being considered not up other work others though this some staff taking holiday or being laid for time on newspapers where reviews depended almost wholly on accident lightly assigned most irresponsibly performed i have heard difficult kind newspaper writing on whole most incompetence there no doubt whatever on whole most large amount reviewing determined by doubtless wellmeaning little more basis than good many other general ideas but very reviewing determined by fear or favour general idea which has public establishment similar character any large amount least as bench judges or staff mint or any should do would be make order reviewers as close one at if i were dictator one first nonpolitical things i matter theory nothing ought much less be case i think person as matter practice this no doubt too often case as discharge their functions may happen be combined same accidentally imperfect arrangements world kinds have nothing do each other essentially though usual humour suggested critics reviewers are two different critic great ingenuity my friend mr andrew lang has his after their disagreeable way have retorted this was obvious they have never personally benefited by criticism critics anonymously or otherwise authors or some them have remarked well say present writer has not yet taken part either argument between authors criticsan argument which may be as not yet been handled we have recently seen revived sempiternal some readers expectations discussion subject which has possible title kinds criticism may have excited  are not prejudicial excellence product which no doubt conduce uniformity within obvious limits renewing his plant he usually eschewed new materialconditions practically left off reading say he carefully avoided exultingly after comparatively early time life he range was not so wide as his penetration was deep he avows almost does not fail justify rule for truth hazlitts critical development as case hazlitt but remarkable exception doubt there will be an apparent exception rule critical he has been relatively quite as right admiring occasionally no combinations work which under other aspects other combinations relatively right condemning from certain aspects certain are some absolute truths criticism man will often be profiting by application after all there are few though there means they have been constantly applying comparative method standards have altered at different times their career this simply brought against some great critics charge their critical which he forms early days his reading there has often been less or more correct generalisations which critic starts or constant process weakening or strengthening as case may be which distinguish two way which does this by wholly finally attain knowledge exact characteristics work by giving constantly nearer approach though perhaps may never fool constantly greater power distinguishing good work from bad its examples as particulars gives i think speaking as throw no small light interest on study literature as whole have attained or ever will attain character science at least generalisations which though as i have said i do not believe they not or at least should not leads like all method does lead only statistics classifications certainly does reading method must lead somewhere whither does this method lead or may be asked what end which you propose for this comparative  accounted wise mans paradise as other provinces but none these provinces has usually been delightful country cockaigne criticism as agreeable illusions interferes good deal personal comfort cockaigne thankless even positively fruitless work brushes away good many practice any art mystery involves great deal tedious granted but say this say no more than thoroughgoing himself were not well for us as others use take all this for look back on days months years laborious reading say serene nonchalance some his fellows he will sometimes have critic this kind will not be able neglect uninteresting best authority england on gray shirtings on other hand which attached modest boast somebody he was third will sometimes have more gushing persons slightly ludicrous air cautiously superlatives his commendations when he gives them apparent delight some his class he will deal very this kind will very rarely be able indulge engouement which can answer little more than may be so certainly critic aristocracy fervour rapture sthetic passion this one he lacks exclusiveness fastidiousness intellectual peddling fancy for discovering beauties most insignificant ungentlemanly habit seeing blemishes greatest pottering lover too little an enthusiast he has an irritating its way comparative critic becomes too much universal another objection more fantastic appearance but rather attractive  particularity knowledge constantly made more minute province but area survey may be constantly increased could hardly take whole critical knowledge be their joint products life methuselah mind shakespeare together perplexingly arranged than all its abundant material dispositions than this planet far more diverse far more intricately because intellect artistic faculty man are far vaster indeed will never be as complete one instance as other book or an author should call up similar mental picture picture relations short man critical head mention its bearings other places its history its products all its man geographical head mention place at once suggests conned provides man conspectus orbis terrarum mind sort conspectus literature as good atlas thoroughly art its end as far as individual concerned provide way criticism proper as i understand long difficult most popular criticism i do not think they will ever stand less agreeable language which are perhaps or rather certainly what way those flowing deliverances personal opinion more or literatures this constant reference comparison may indeed stand their analogues their opposites same other constant habit looking at everything every writer conjunction be further improved by still more catholic sympathy still more literature on some other things his own excellent censorship might preaching i should say on medival literature on romantic like most us does not practise quite up level his authority than i have done myself yet i half think m brunetire necessity comparison not less positively no doubt far more distinguished from science criticism insisting on i have found m brunetire speaking about critical method as this however was written some seven or eight years ago since then understand m brunetire rather too methodical classification english writer par cases et par compartiments say as i much as most learned living french critics once observed an have ventured call comparative criticism proceeds too only objection validity i have ever seen taken what i  my not infrequent reading circulating library novels do not appreciate classics many literatures all better from respects classics many literatures i am not sure i so much as circulating library novel if i did not perpetually pay my comparison for my own part i should not dare continue criticising clever american does not know he has not sufficient range education reason error quite obvious simply read what mr howells says mr thackeray almost an illiberal books as showing what happens when man speaks without knowledge things they will be one most valuable one most terrible have collection mr howellss critical dicta on novels other becomes spectacle men angels i hope we shall one day branch art who suddenly without preparation takes another excellent though late years slightly depraved practitioner one for grace god here clever man very clever man an howells for my part i only shudder echo celebrated there but disdaining this preparation some my friends jeer or comminate at mr awful example an exceedingly clever writer who has commenced critic critics will ever be made without we have at this moment an thing will not course by itself make critic but few are for after all this reading which main principal  tolerably careful reading attempts they have been made on basis tolerably wide unsuccessful faulty i only plead for them they are such not i should be first admit my own attempts do this are other lights very often i think must be admitted he has certain aspects due allowance for possibility other aspects grasp literary sum place his man under certain lights swell literary sum but has he done anything aid general fellow he he may have his own person contributed good literature he may have said many pretty things he may have shown what clever any these questions seem have been even considered by critic accomplished examples literature ostensibly critical which few if particular instance i have read very famous their way very excused for calling comparative method literature department how far short has he applied what i may perhaps be history its own language collection authors its own subject general history literature particular effects how far has he attempted place succeeded placing main peculiarities subject their proximate causes subject which he has set himself consider how far has he referred again how far has this critic seen steadily seen whole give tolerably instructed person who did not know original value criticism what idea original would this critic manners literature itself test question as i should put think be not inconsiderable study widely differing periods forms them as condition preliminary this process there must i other as well as same languages some endeavour class value subjects considered some effort compare them their likes must be at least some attempt take render whole virtue parenthetic reference matter hand are not criticism there view on taste shakespeare musical glasses some criticism most admirable discourses from merely literary point even most legitimate setsoff critical conversation are not mere obiter dicta any kind though they may be most agreeable mental power no small specially critical ability not criticism mieux alfred de musset though came from man extraordinary out criticism are not by themselves judgment famous jaime judge expressions personal liking though they can hardly be kept can never be discharged except by those who remember critic means for full proper office critic again as seems me  agreeable even useful function his own full proper office critic though he may have an better case than others but still he as seems me misses chooses represent has produced on him this last own way show impression which subject has or which he present there purely impressionist critic who endeavours his prevail rare find an individual whom one alone melt into one another so while any individual one may display style lastly though as usual all these kinds pervade first all sometimes no further aim an opportunity for there third closely allied him who seeks apparently term elaborate descants makes theme complicated variations kind who founds on his subject if indeed founding be not too solemn ever had better examples him than this age there more serious wit this perhaps most popular all critics no age has natural grace agility his urbane learning his faculty pleasant sort springboard or platform on from which display his their various kinds there critic who simply uses his subject as many votaries most countries at present day these votaries have things which mr goldwin smith complains which certainly has inclined men other conception criticism as saying fine no doubt sense conscious or unconscious this has  do

criticism useless course there are generalisations possible literature find all her elaborate plant formulas generalisations by incalculable singular influences she must be constantly baffled constantly reduced species one these laws are set at nought classes only general laws so long as these classes are makes science any proper sense powerless she can deal only communicated by individual they depend upon idiosyncrasy this altered for essential qualities literature as all art are word scientific have its meaning very illegitimately demonstrable scientific literary criticism impossible unless criticism which not scientific for rest all but its ways formulas are not perceptibly distinguishable from those criticism when as sometimes happens good criticism closest its own formulas ways

rejected too often rather ludicrous something possessing sort awkward others this something varies very much appeal sometimes nay couplet too there something which distinguishes from almost all
