Tarrytown
(Traditional)

In Tarry-town there did dwell
A handsome youth I knew so well
He courted me my life away,
And now with me he will no longer stay.

Wide and deep my grave will be
With the wild good grasses growing over me
Wide and deep my grave will be
With the wild goose grasses growing over me

Oh once I wore my apron low
He's follow me through ice and snow
Now that I wear my apron high
You walk right down the street and pass me by.

Wide and deep my grave will be
With the wild good grasses growing over me
Wide and deep my grave will be
With the wild goose grasses growing over me

There is an inn in Tarrytown
Where my love goes and sits him down
He takes another on his knee
For she has golden lashes more than me

Wide and deep my grave will be
With the wild good grasses growing over me
Wide and deep my grave will be
With the wild goose grasses growing over me
