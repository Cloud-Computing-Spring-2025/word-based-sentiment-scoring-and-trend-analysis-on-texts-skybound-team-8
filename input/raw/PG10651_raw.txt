Shenandoah
(Traditional)

Oh Shenandoah, I love your daughter
Way-aye, your rolling river
I'll take her 'cross yon rolling water
Away--we're bound away 'cross the wide Missouri!

The Chief disdained the trader's dollars,
Way-aye, you rolling river
My daughter you shall never follow
Away--we're bound away 'cross the wide Missouri!

For seven years I courted Sally,
Way-aye, you rolling river
For seven more I longed to have her
Away--we're bound away 'cross the wide Missouri!

She said she would not be my lover
Way-aye, you rolling river
Because I was a tarry sailor
Away--we're bound away 'cross the wide Missouri!

At last there came a Yankee skipper
Way-aye, you rolling river
He winked his eye, and he tipped his flipper
Away--we're bound away 'cross the wide Missouri!

He sold the Chief that fire-water
Way-aye, you rolling river
And 'cross the river he stole his daughter
Away--we're bound away 'cross the wide Missouri!

Oh Shenandoah, I love your daughter
Way-aye, you rolling river
I'll take her 'cross yon rolling water
Away--we're bound away 'cross the wide Missouri!
